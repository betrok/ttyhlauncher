# ttyhlauncher

Open source implementation of the old ttyh.ru launcher under the GNU GPL version 3.

We are against the use of the launcher for illegal purposes, it is written just for fun. If you like minecraft, buy the game and support the developer.

## Dependecies

1. Qt (5.3 minimum)
2. QuaZip (tested with 0.7)
